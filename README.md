It includes the twitter analysis dashboard using Power BI by Ashwini Talakal
1. Introduction

The increasing use of social media for brand engagement, marketing, and public communication has generated massive amounts of user interaction data. This project was centered around analyzing Twitter engagement using Power BI, a leading business intelligence tool. The focus was to not only visualize data but to dynamically control what gets shown based on the time of day and advanced tweet filters, simulating a real-time decision-support system.

2. Background

Organizations increasingly demand tools that provide meaningful insights from complex social media datasets. Twitter, a microblogging platform, presents unique analytical opportunities due to the volume and variety of user interactions such as likes, retweets, profile clicks, hashtag usage, and media views.

This project was initiated to develop a Power BI dashboard using Twitter data extracted into an Excel spreadsheet format (`SocialMedia.xlsx`). The requirement was to create advanced, **rule-driven visualizations** based on multiple dimensions including engagement metrics, tweet content properties (like character and word counts), timestamps, and other interaction types.

3. Learning Objectives

* Understand Twitter's engagement and interaction metrics and how they relate to content virality.
* Implement **multi-level filters** in Power BI dashboards, including text-based, numerical, and temporal logic.
* Learn how to create **time-sensitive visuals**, which appear or disappear based on system time, using DAX and dynamic visibility.
* Develop skills in data cleaning, DAX formula writing, Power Query transformations, and best practices in dashboard UI/UX.

4. Activities and Tasks

1. Develop a chart that displays tweets with the highest engagement rates (top 10%). Include only those tweets that have received more than 50 likes and were posted on weekdays and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself as well as tweet character count should be below 30.

2. Create a clustered bar chart that breaks down the sum of URL clicks, user profile clicks, and hashtag clicks by tweet category (e.g., tweets with media, tweets with links, tweets with hashtags). Only include tweets that have at least one of these interaction types and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet date should be even number as well as tweet word count be above 40.

3. Create a dual-axis chart that shows the number of media views and media engagements by the day of the week for the last quarter. Highlight days with significant spikes in media interactions. this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST and 7 AM to 11AM apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet impression should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet character count should be above 30 and need to remove tweet word which has letter 'H'.

9. Conclusion

This Twitter Analysis project provided in-depth exposure to data analysis, visualization, and conditional logic implementation in Power BI. From understanding tweet content metrics to applying rigorous filters based on time and content attributes, the experience enhanced both technical and analytical capabilities. The successful delivery of a fully functional and intelligent dashboard reflects the project's complexity and real-world applicability.
